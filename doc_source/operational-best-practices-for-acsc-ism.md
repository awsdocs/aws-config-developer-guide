# Operational Best Practices for ACSC ISM<a name="operational-best-practices-for-acsc-ism"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

The following provides a sample mapping between the Australian Cyber Security Centre \(ACSC\) Information Security Manual \(ISM\) 2020\-06 and AWS managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more ISM controls\. An ISM control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

This sample conformance pack template contains mappings to controls within the ISM framework, which was created by the Commonwealth of Australia and can be found at [Australian Government Information Security Manual](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism/cyber-security-principles)\. Licensing of the framework under Creative Commons Attribution 4\.0 International Public License and copyright information for the framework \(including a disclaimer of warranties\) can be found at [ACSC \| Copyright](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/copyright)\.
