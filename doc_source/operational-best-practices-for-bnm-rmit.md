# Operational Best Practices for BNM RMiT<a name="operational-best-practices-for-bnm-rmit"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.  

The following provides a sample mapping between the Bank Negara Malaysia \(BNM\) Risk Management in Technology \(RMiT\) and AWS managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more BNM RMiT controls\. A BNM RMiT control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

**AWS Region:** All AWS Regions where conformance packs are supported \([Region support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-packs.html#conformance-packs-regions)\) except AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\), AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\), and Middle East \(Bahrain\)
