# Operational Best Practices for NCSC Cyber Assesment Framework<a name="operational-best-practices-for-ncsc_cafv3"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\. 

The following provides a sample mapping between UK National Cyber Security Centre \(NCSC\) Cyber Assessment Framework \(CAF\) controls and AWS managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more UK NCSC CAF controls\. A UK NCSC CAF control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\. 

This sample conformance pack template contains mappings to controls within the UK NCSC CAF \([National Cyber Security Centre \| NCSC CAF guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/cyber-assessment-framework)\), with such public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3\.0\.
