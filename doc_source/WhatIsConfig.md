# What Is AWS Config?<a name="WhatIsConfig"></a>

AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account\. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time\. 

An AWS *resource* is an entity you can work with in AWS, such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(EC2\) instance, an Amazon Elastic Block Store \(EBS\) volume, a security group, or an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\)\. For a complete list of AWS resources supported by AWS Config, see [Supported Resource Types](resource-config-reference.md)\.

## Features<a name="config-features"></a>

When you set up AWS Config, you can complete the following:

**Resource management**
+ Specify the resource types you want AWS Config to record\.
+ Set up an Amazon S3 bucket to receive a configuration snapshot on request and configuration history\.
+ Set up Amazon SNS to send configuration stream notifications\.
+ Grant AWS Config the permissions it needs to access the Amazon S3 bucket and the Amazon SNS topic\.

  For more information, see [Viewing AWS Resource Configurations and History](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/view-manage-resource.html) and [Managing AWS Resource Configurations and History](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/manage-config.html)\.

**Rules and conformance packs**
+ Specify the rules that you want AWS Config to use to evaluate compliance information for the recorded resource types\.
+ Use conformance packs, or a collection of AWS Config rules and remediation actions that can be deployed and monitored as a single entity in your AWS account\.

  For more information, see [Evaluating Resources with AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html) and [Conformance Packs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-packs.html)\.

**Aggregators**
+ Use an aggregator to get a centralized view of your resource inventory and compliance\. An aggregator is an AWS Config resource type that collects AWS Config configuration and compliance data from multiple AWS accounts and AWS Regions into a single account and Region\.

  For more information, see [Multi\-Account Multi\-Region Data Aggregation ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/aggregate-data.html)\.

**Advanced queries**
+ Use one of the sample queries or write your own query by referring to the configuration schema of the AWS resource\.

  For more information, see [Querying the Current Configuration State of AWS Resources ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/querying-AWS-resources.html)\. 

## Ways to Use AWS Config<a name="common-scenarios"></a>

When you run your applications on AWS, you usually use AWS resources, which you must create and manage collectively\. As the demand for your application keeps growing, so does your need to keep track of your AWS resources\. AWS Config is designed to help you oversee your application resources in the following scenarios: 

### Resource Administration<a name="scenarios-resource-administration"></a>

To exercise better governance over your resource configurations and to detect resource misconfigurations, you need fine\-grained visibility into what resources exist and how these resources are configured at any time\. You can use AWS Config to notify you whenever resources are created, modified, or deleted without having to monitor these changes by polling the calls made to each resource\.

You can use AWS Config rules to evaluate the configuration settings of your AWS resources\. When AWS Config detects that a resource violates the conditions in one of your rules, AWS Config flags the resource as noncompliant and sends a notification\. AWS Config continuously evaluates your resources as they are created, changed, or deleted\.

### Auditing and Compliance<a name="scenarios-auditing-and-compliance"></a>

You might be working with data that requires frequent audits to ensure compliance with internal policies and best practices\. To demonstrate compliance, you need access to the historical configurations of your resources\. This information is provided by AWS Config\.

### Managing and Troubleshooting Configuration Changes<a name="scenarios-managing-and-troubleshooting-configuration-changes"></a>

When you use multiple AWS resources that depend on one another, a change in the configuration of one resource might have unintended consequences on related resources\. With AWS Config, you can view how the resource you intend to modify is related to other resources and assess the impact of your change\. 

You can also use the historical configurations of your resources provided by AWS Config to troubleshoot issues and to access the last known good configuration of a problem resource\.

### Security Analysis<a name="w2aab5b9c11"></a>

To analyze potential security weaknesses, you need detailed historical information about your AWS resource configurations, such as the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) permissions that are granted to your users, or the Amazon EC2 security group rules that control access to your resources\.

You can use AWS Config to view the IAM policy that was assigned to a user, group, or role at any time in which AWS Config was recording\. This information can help you determine the permissions that belonged to a user at a specific time: for example, you can view whether the user `John Doe` had permission to modify Amazon VPC settings on Jan 1, 2015\.

You can also use AWS Config to view the configuration of your EC2 security groups, including the port rules that were open at a specific time\. This information can help you determine whether a security group blocked incoming TCP traffic to a specific port\.
