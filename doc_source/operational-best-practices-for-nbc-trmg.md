# Operational Best Practices for NBC TRMG<a name="operational-best-practices-for-nbc-trmg"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

The following provides a sample mapping between the National Bank of Cambodia’s \(NBC\) Technology Risk Management \(TRM\) Guidelines framework and AWS managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more NBC TRM Guideline\. An NBC TRM Guideline can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

This sample conformance pack template contains mappings to controls within the National Bank of Cambodia’s \(NBC\) Technology Risk Management \(TRM\) Guidelines framework, which can be accessed here: [National Bank of Cambodia: Technology Risk Mangement Guidelines](https://www.nbc.org.kh/download_files/publication/itguideline_eng/NBC-Risk-Management-Guidelines-July%202019.pdf)\.
