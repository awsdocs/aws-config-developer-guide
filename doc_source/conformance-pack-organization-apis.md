# Managing Conformance Packs Across all Accounts in Your Organization<a name="conformance-pack-organization-apis"></a>

Use AWS Config to manage conformance packs across all AWS accounts within an organization\. You can do the following:
+ Centrally deploy, update, and delete conformance packs across member accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations\.
+ Deploy a common set of AWS Config rules and remediation actions across all accounts and specify accounts where AWS Config rules and remediation actions should not be created\.
+ Use the APIs from the management account in AWS Organizations to enforce governance by ensuring that the underlying AWS Config rules and remediation actions are not modifiable by your organizationâ€™s member accounts\.

**Note**  
**For deployments across different regions**  
The API call to deploy rules and conformance packs across accounts is region specific\. At the organization level, you need to change the context of your API call to a different region if you want to deploy rules in other regions\. For example, to deploy a rule in US East \(N\. Virginia\), change the region to US East \(N\. Virginia\) and then call `PutOrganizationConfigRule`\.  
**For accounts within an organzation**  
If a new account joins an organization, the rule or conformance pack is deployed to that account\. When an account leaves an organization, the rule or conformance pack is removed\.  
If you deploy an organizational rule or conformance pack in an organization administrator account, and then establish a delegated administrator and deploy an organizational rule or conformance pack in the delegated administrator account, you won't be able to see the organizational rule or conformance pack in the organization administrator account from the delegated administrator account or see the organizational rule or conformance pack in the delegated administrator account from organization administrator account\. The [DescribeOrganizationConfigRules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganizationConfigRules.html) and [DescribeOrganizationConformancePacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganizationConformancePacks.html) APIs can only see and interact with the organization\-related resource that were deployed from within the account calling those APIs\.   
**Retry mechanism for new accounts added to an organization**  
Deployment of existing organizational rules and conformance packs will only be retried for 7 hours after an account is added to your organization if a recorder is not available\. You are expected to create a recorder if one doesn't exist within 7 hours of adding an account to your organization\.

To a deploy a conformance pack across an organization from the AWS console, use AWS Systems Manager\. For more information, see [Deploy AWS Config conformance packs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/quick-setup-cpack.html) in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide\.

Ensure AWS Config recording is on before you use the following APIs to manage conformance pack rules across all AWS accounts within an organization:
+ [DeleteOrganizationConformancePack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteOrganizationConformancePack.html), deletes the specified organization conformance pack and all of the config rules and remediation actions from all member accounts in that organization\.
+ [DescribeOrganizationConformancePacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganizationConformancePacks.html), returns a list of organization conformance packs\.
+ [DescribeOrganizationConformancePackStatuses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganizationConformancePackStatuses.html), provides organization conformance pack deployment status for an organization\.
+ [GetOrganizationConformancePackDetailedStatus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_GetOrganizationConformancePackDetailedStatus.html), returns detailed status for each member account within an organization for a given organization conformance pack\.
+ [PutOrganizationConformancePack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_PutOrganizationConformancePack.html), deploys conformance packs across member accounts in an AWS Organization\.
