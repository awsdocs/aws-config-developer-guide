Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

 The following provides a sample mapping between the Center for Internet Security \(CIS\) Critical Security Controls v8 IG1 and AWS managed Config rules\. Each AWS Config applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more CIS Critical Security Controls v8 IG1 controls\. A CIS Critical Security Controls v8 IG1 control can be related to multiple AWS Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

**AWS Region:** All AWS Regions where conformance packs are supported \([Region support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-packs.html#conformance-packs-regions)\) except AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\) and AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\)
