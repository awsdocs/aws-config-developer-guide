# Selecting Which Resources AWS Config Records<a name="select-resources"></a>

AWS Config continuously detects when any resource of a supported type is created, changed, or deleted\. AWS Config records these events as configuration items\. You can customize AWS Config to record changes for all supported types of resources or for only those types that are relevant to you\. To learn which types of resources AWS Config can record, see [Supported Resource Types](resource-config-reference.md)\.

**Note**  
** High Number of AWS Config Evaluations**  
You may notice increased activity in your account during your initial month recording with AWS Config when compared to subsequent months\. During the initial bootstrapping process, AWS Config goes through all the resources in your account that you have selected for AWS Config to record\.  
If you are running ephemeral workloads, you may see increased activity from AWS Config as it records configuration changes associated with creating and deleting these temporary resources\. An ephemeral workload is a temporary use of computing resources that are loaded and run when needed\. Examples include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) spot instances, Amazon EMR jobs, and AWS Auto Scaling\. If you want to avoid the increased activity from running ephemeral workloads, you can run these types of workloads in a separate account with AWS Config turned off to avoid increased configuration recording and rule evaluations\.

## Recording All Supported Resource Types<a name="select-resources-all"></a>

By default, AWS Config records the configuration changes for all current and future supported types of *regional resources* that AWS Config discovers in the region in which it is running\. When AWS Config adds support for a new type of regional resource, it starts recording resources of that type automatically\. Regional resources are tied to a region and can be used only in that region\. Examples of regional resources are Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EBS volumes\.

You can also have AWS Config record supported types of *global resources*\. Global resources are not tied to a specific region and can be used in all regions\. The global resource types that AWS Config supports include IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies\.

**Important**  
Global resource types onboarded to AWS Config recording after February 2022 will only be recorded in the service's home region for the commercial partition and AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\) for the GovCloud partition\. You can view the Configuration Items for these new global resource types only in their home region and AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\)\.  
Supported global resource types onboarded before February 2022 such as `AWS::IAM::Group`, `AWS::IAM::Policy`, `AWS::IAM::Role`, `AWS::IAM::User` remain unchanged, and they will continue to deliver Configuration Items in all supported regions in AWS Config\. The change will only affect new global resource types onboarded after February 2022\.  
To record global resource types onboarded after February 2022, enable All Supported Resource Types in the home region of the global resource type you want to record\.

## Recording Specific Resource Types<a name="select-resources-specific"></a>

If you don't want AWS Config to record the changes for all supported resources, you can customize it to record changes for only specific types\. AWS Config records configuration changes for the types of resources that you specify, including the creation and deletion of such resources\.

If a resource is not recorded, AWS Config captures only the creation and deletion of that resource, and no other details, at no cost to you\. When a nonrecorded resource is created or deleted, AWS Config sends a notification, and it displays the event on the resource details page\. The details page for a nonrecorded resource provides null values for most configuration details, and it does not provide information about relationships and configuration changes\.

The relationship information that AWS Config provides for recorded resources is not limited because of missing data for nonrecorded resources\. If a recorded resource is related to a nonrecorded resource, that relationship is provided in the details page of the recorded resource\.

You can stop AWS Config from recording a type of resource any time\. After AWS Config stops recording a resource, it retains the configuration information that was previously captured, and you can continue to access this information\.

AWS Config rules can be used to evaluate compliance for only those resources that AWS Config records\.

## AWS Config Rules and Global Resource Types<a name="select-resources-rules-and-global"></a>

Global resource types onboarded before February 2022 \(`AWS::IAM::Group`, `AWS::IAM::Policy`, `AWS::IAM::Role`, and `AWS::IAM::User`\) are recorded by AWS Config in all supported regions\. This means that periodic rules that report compliance on these global resources will continue running evaluations in all supported regions, *even in* regions where you have not enabled the recording of global resources\.

**Note**  
Periodic rules can run on resources that AWS Config recording does not support and can be run without the configuration recorder being enabled\. Periodic rules do not depend on configuration items\. For more information on the difference between change–triggered rules and periodic rules, see [Specifying Triggers for AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config-rules.html)\.

If you are not recording global resource types onboarded before February 2022, it is recommended that you do not enable the following periodic rules in order to avoid unnecessary costs:
+ [access\-keys\-rotated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/access-keys-rotated.html)

**Best Practices for reporting compliance on global resources**

If you are recording global resource types onboarded before February 2022 \(`AWS::IAM::Group`, `AWS::IAM::Policy`, `AWS::IAM::Role`, and `AWS::IAM::User`\), you should only deploy AWS Config rules and conformance packs that have these global resources in scope in one of the supported regions in order to avoid costs and API throttling\. This applies to regular AWS Config rules, organizational AWS Config rules, as well as rules created by other AWS services \(like Security Hub and Control Tower\)\.

Global resource types onboarded to AWS Config recording after February 2022 will only be recorded in the service's home region for the commercial partition and AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\) for the GovCloud partition\. You should only deploy AWS Config rules and conformance packs that have these global resources in scope in the resource type's home region\. For more information, see [Home Regions for Global Resource Types Onboarded after February 2022](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/select-resources.html#select-resources-all)\.

## Selecting Resources \(Console\)<a name="select-resources-console"></a>

You can use the AWS Config console to select the types of resources that AWS Config records\.

**To select resources**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/config/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/)\.

1. Open the **Settings** page:
   + If you are using AWS Config in a region that supports AWS Config rules, choose **Settings** in the navigation pane\. For the list of supported regions, see [AWS Config Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#awsconfig_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.
   + Otherwise, choose the settings icon \(![\[settings icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/images/gear.png)\) on the **Resource inventory** page\.

1. In the **Resource types to record** section, specify which types of AWS resources you want AWS Config to record:
   + **All resources** – AWS Config records all supported resources with the following options:
     + **Record all resources supported in this region** – AWS Config records configuration changes for every supported type of regional resource\. When AWS Config adds support for a new type of regional resource, it automatically starts recording resources of that type\.
     + **Include global resources** – AWS Config includes supported types of global resources with the resources that it records \(for example, IAM resources\)\. When AWS Config adds support for a new type of global resource, it automatically starts recording resources of that type\.
   + **Specific types** – AWS Config records configuration changes for only those types of AWS resources that you specify\.

1. Save your changes:
   + If you are using AWS Config in a region that supports AWS Config rules, choose **Save**\.
   + Otherwise, choose **Continue**\. In the **AWS Config Config is requesting permissions to read your resources' configuration** page, choose **Allow**\.

## Selecting Resources \(AWS CLI\)<a name="select-resources-cli"></a>

You can use the AWS CLI to select the types of resources that you want AWS Config to record\. You do this by creating a configuration recorder, which records the types of resources that you specify in a recording group\. In the recording group, you specify whether all supported types or specific types of resources are recorded\.

**To select all supported resources**

1. Use the following [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/put-configuration-recorder.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/put-configuration-recorder.html) command:

   ```
   $ aws configservice put-configuration-recorder --configuration-recorder name=default,roleARN=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/config-role --recording-group allSupported=true,includeGlobalResourceTypes=true
   ```

   This command uses the following options for the `--recording-group` parameter:
   + `allSupported=true` – AWS Config records configuration changes for every supported type of *regional resource*\. When AWS Config adds support for a new type of regional resource, it automatically starts recording resources of that type\.
   + 

     `includeGlobalResourceTypes=true` – AWS Config includes supported types of global resources with the resources that it records\. When AWS Config adds support for a new type of global resource, it automatically starts recording resources of that type\.

     Before you can set this option to `true`, you must set the `allSupported` option to `true`\.

     If you do not want to include global resources, set this option to `false`, or omit it\.

1. \(Optional\) To verify that your configuration recorder has the settings that you want, use the following [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/describe-configuration-recorders.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/describe-configuration-recorders.html) command:

   ```
   $ aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders
   ```

   The following is an example response:

   ```
   {
       "ConfigurationRecorders": [
           {
               "recordingGroup": {
                   "allSupported": true,
                   "resourceTypes": [],
                   "includeGlobalResourceTypes": true
               },
               "roleARN": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/config-role",
               "name": "default"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

**To select specific types of resources**

1. Use the `AWS Configservice` [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/put-configuration-recorder.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/put-configuration-recorder.html) command, and pass one or more resource types through the `--recording-group` option, as shown in the following example:

   ```
   $ aws configservice put-configuration-recorder --configuration-recorder name=default,roleARN=arn:aws:iam::012345678912:role/myConfigRole --recording-group file://recordingGroup.json
   ```

   The `recordingGroup.json` file specifies which types of resources AWS Config will record:

   ```
   {
     "allSupported": false,
     "includeGlobalResourceTypes": false,
     "resourceTypes": [
       "AWS::EC2::EIP",
       "AWS::EC2::Instance",
       "AWS::EC2::NetworkAcl",
       "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup",
       "AWS::CloudTrail::Trail",
       "AWS::EC2::Volume",
       "AWS::EC2::VPC",
       "AWS::IAM::User",
       "AWS::IAM::Policy"
     ]
   }
   ```

   Before you can specify resource types for the `resourceTypes` key, you must set the `allSupported` and `includeGlobalResourceTypes` options to false or omit them\.

1. \(Optional\) To verify that your configuration recorder has the settings that you want, use the following [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/describe-configuration-recorders.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/describe-configuration-recorders.html) command:

   ```
   $ aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders
   ```

   The following is an example response:

   ```
   {
       "ConfigurationRecorders": [
           {
               "recordingGroup": {
                   "allSupported": false,
                   "resourceTypes": [
                       "AWS::EC2::EIP",
                       "AWS::EC2::Instance",
                       "AWS::EC2::NetworkAcl",
                       "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup",
                       "AWS::CloudTrail::Trail",
                       "AWS::EC2::Volume",
                       "AWS::EC2::VPC",
                       "AWS::IAM::User",
                       "AWS::IAM::Policy"
                   ],
                   "includeGlobalResourceTypes": false
               },
               "roleARN": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/config-role",
               "name": "default"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
