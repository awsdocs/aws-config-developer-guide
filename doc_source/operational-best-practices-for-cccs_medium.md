# Operational Best Practices for Canadian Centre for Cyber Security \(CCCS\) Medium Cloud Control Profile<a name="operational-best-practices-for-cccs_medium"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

The following provides a sample mapping between the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security \(CCCS\) Medium Cloud Control Profile and AWS managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more CCCS Medium Cloud Control Profile controls\. A CCCS Medium Cloud Control Profile control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\. 

**AWS Region:** All AWS Regions where conformance packs are supported \([Region support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-packs.html#conformance-packs-regions)\) except AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\), AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\), Middle East \(Bahrain\) and South America \(SÃ£o Paulo\)
