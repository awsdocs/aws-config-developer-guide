# Operational Best Practices for CMMC Level 2<a name="operational-best-practices-for-cmmc_level_2"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

The following provides a sample mapping between the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification \(CMMC\) Level 2 and AWS managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more CMMC Level 2 controls\. A CMMC Level 2 control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

**AWS Region:** All supported AWS Regions except Middle East \(Bahrain\)
