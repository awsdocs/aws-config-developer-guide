# Operational Best Practices for ACSC Essential 8<a name="operational-best-practices-for-acsc_essential_8"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

The following provides a sample mapping between the Australian Cyber Security Centre \(ACSC\) Essential Eight Maturity Model and AWS managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more ACSC Essential Eight controls\. An ACSC Essential Eight control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\. Some of the mappings to config rules are for the higher order section \(eg\. Mitigation Strategies to Limit the Extent of Cyber Security Incidents\) as opposed to the more prescriptive sections\.

This sample conformance pack template contains mappings to controls within the ACSC Essential 8, which was created by the Commonwealth of Australia and can be found at [ACSC \| Essential Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/essential-eight)\.

**AWS Region:** All supported AWS Regions except Asia Pacific \(Hong Kong\), Middle East \(Bahrain\), and South America \(São Paulo\)
