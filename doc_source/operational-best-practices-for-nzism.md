# Operational Best Practices for NZISM<a name="operational-best-practices-for-nzism"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

The following provides a sample mapping between the [New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau \(GCSB\) Information Security Manual \(NZISM\) 2022\-09 Version 3\.6](https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document) and AWS Managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more NZISM controls\. An NZISM control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

This sample conformance pack template contains mappings to controls within the NZISM framework, which is an integral part of the Protective Security Requirements \(PSR\) framework that sets out the New Zealand Government’s expectations for the management of personnel, information and physical security\.
