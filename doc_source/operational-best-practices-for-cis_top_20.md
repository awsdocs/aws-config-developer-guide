# Operational Best Practices for CIS Top 20<a name="operational-best-practices-for-cis_top_20"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

The following provides a sample mapping between the Center for Internet Security \(CIS\) Top 20 Critical Security Controls and AWS managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more CIS Top 20 controls\. A CIS Top 20 control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

This Conformance Pack was validated by AWS Security Assurance Services LLC \(AWS SAS\), which is a team of Payment Card Industry Qualified Security Assessors \(QSAs\), HITRUST Certified Common Security Framework Practitioners \(CCSFPs\), and compliance professionals certified to provide guidance and assessments for various industry frameworks\. AWS SAS professionals designed this Conformance Pack to enable a customer to align to a subset of the CIS Top 20\.

**AWS Region:** All AWS Regions where conformance packs are supported \([Region support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-packs.html#conformance-packs-regions)\) except AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\), AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\), and Middle East \(Bahrain\)
