# Operational Best Practices for RBI Cyber Security Framework for UCBs<a name="operational-best-practices-for-rbi-bcsf-ucb"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

The following provides a sample mapping between the Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\) Cyber Security Framework for Urban Cooperative Banks \(UCBs\) and AWS managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more RBI Cyber Security Framework for UCBs controls\. An RBI Cyber Security Framework for UCBs control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

**AWS Region:** All AWS Regions where conformance packs are supported \([Region support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-packs.html#conformance-packs-regions)\) except AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\), AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\), and Middle East \(Bahrain\)
