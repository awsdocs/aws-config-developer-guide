# Creating AWS Config Custom Policy Rules<a name="evaluate-config_develop-rules_cfn-guard"></a>

You can create AWS Config Custom Policy rules from the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS Config API\. For more information on how to write rules with Guard, see [Writing Guard rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cfn-guard/latest/ug/writing-rules.html) in the AWS CloudFormation Guard User Guide\. For more information on the schemas of supported resource types that AWS Config can evaluate, see [resource\-types](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-config-resource-schema/tree/master/config/properties/resource-types) in the AWS Config Resource Schema GitHub Repository\.

**Important**  
The AWS Config resource schema to evaluate configuration items is *different* than the CFN schema to evaluate AWS CloudFormation templates\. If you use the CFN schema for AWS Config Custom Policy rules, your evaluation results will return `NOT_APPLICABLE`\. Use the AWS Config resource schema when creating AWS Config Custom Policy rules and write policies based on the configuration item structure\. For a list AWS Config resource schemas, see [resource\-types](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-config-resource-schema/tree/master/config/properties/resource-types) in the AWS Config Resource Schema GitHub Repository\.

## Creating AWS Config Custom Policy Rules \(Console\)<a name="create-cfn-guard-rule-console"></a>

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/config/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/)\.

1. In the AWS Management Console menu, verify that the Region selector is set to an AWS Region that supports AWS Config rules\. For the list of supported Regions, see [AWS Config Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/awsconfig.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. 

1. In the left navigation, choose **Rules**\. 

1. On the **Rules** page, choose **Add rule**\. 

1. On the **Specify rule type** page, choose **Create custom rule using Guard**\.

1. On the **Configure rule** page, create your rule by completing the following steps:

   1. For **Rule name**, type a unique name for the rule\.

   1. For **Description**, type a description for the rule\.

   1. For **Guard runtime version**, choose the runtime system for your AWS Config Custom Policy rule\.

   1. For **Rule Content**, you can populate it with the Guard Custom policy for your rule\. For more information about the structure and features for Guard Custom policies, see the [AWS CloudFormation Guard 2\.0's Modes of Operation](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard/tree/main/guard) in the Guard GitHub Repository\.
**Note**  
The AWS Config resource schema to evaluate configuration items is *different* than the CFN schema to evaluate AWS CloudFormation templates\. If you use the CFN schema for AWS Config Custom Policy rules, your evaluation results will return `NOT_APPLICABLE`\. Use the AWS Config resource schema when creating AWS Config Custom Policy rules and write policies based on the configuration item structure\. For a list AWS Config resource schemas, see [resource\-types](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-config-resource-schema/tree/master/config/properties/resource-types) in the AWS Config Resource Schema GitHub Repository\.

      The following example shows the policy definition for an AWS Config Custom Policy rule version of the AWS Config Managed rule [dynamodb\-pitr\-enabled](dynamodb-pitr-enabled.md)

      ```
      # This rule checks if point in time recovery (PITR) is enabled on active Amazon DynamoDB tables
      let status = ['ACTIVE']
      
      rule tableisactive when
          resourceType == "AWS::DynamoDB::Table" {
          configuration.tableStatus == %status
      }
      
      rule checkcompliance when
          resourceType == "AWS::DynamoDB::Table"
          tableisactive {
              let pitr = supplementaryConfiguration.ContinuousBackupsDescription.pointInTimeRecoveryDescription.pointInTimeRecoveryStatus
              %pitr == "ENABLED"
      }
      ```

   1. For **Evaluation mode**, choose when in the resource creation and management process you want AWS Config to evaluate your resources\. Depending on the rule, AWS Config can evaluate your resource configurations before a resource has been provisioned, after a resource has been provisoned, or both\.

      1. Choose **Turn on proactive evaluation** to allow you to run evaluations on the configuration settings of your resources before they are deployed\.

         Once you have turned on proactive evaluation, you can use the [StartResourceEvaluation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_StartResourceEvaluation.html) API and [GetResourceEvaluationSummary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_GetResourceEvaluationSummary.html) API to check if the resources you specify in these commands would be flagged as NON\_COMPLIANT by the proactive rules in your account in your Region\.

          For more information on using this commands, see [Evaluating Your Resources with AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluating-your-resources.html#evaluating-your-resources-proactive)\. For a list of managed rules that support proactive evaluation, see [List of AWS Config Managed Rules by Evaluation Mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-evaluation-mode.html)\.

      1. Choose **Turn on detective evaluation** to evaluate the configuration settings of your existing resources\.

         For detective evaluation, AWS Config Custom Policy rules are initiated by **Configuration changes**\. This option will be pre\-selected\.
         +  **Resources** – When a resource that matches the specified resource type, or the type plus identifier, is created, changed, or deleted\.
         +  **Tags** – When a resource with the specified tag is created, changed, or deleted\.
         +  **All changes** – When a resource recorded by AWS Config is created, changed, or deleted\.

         AWS Config runs the evaluation when it detects a change to a resource that matches the rule's scope\. You can use the scope to constrain which resources initiate evaluations\. Otherwise, evaluations are initiated when there is a change to a post\-provisioned resource\.

   1. For **Parameters**, you can customize the values for the provided keys if your rule includes parameters\. A parameter is an attribute that your resources must adhere to before they are considered compliant with the rule\.

1. On the **Review and create** page, review all your selections before adding the rule to your AWS account\.

1. When you finish reviewing your rules, choose **Add rule**\.

## Creating AWS Config Custom Policy Rules \(AWS CLI\)<a name="create-cfn-guard-rule-cli"></a>

Use the [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/put-config-rule.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/put-config-rule.html) command\.

The `Owner` field should be `CUSTOM_POLICY`\. The following additional fields are required for AWS Config Custom Policy rules:
+ `Runtime`: The runtime system for your AWS Config Custom Policy rules\.
+ `PolicyText`: The policy definition containing the logic for your AWS Config Custom Policy rules\.
+ `EnableDebugLogDelivery`: The Boolean expression for enabling debug logging for your AWS Config Custom Policy rule\. The default value is `false`\.

## Creating AWS Config Custom Policy Rules \(API\)<a name="create-cfn-guard-rule-api"></a>

Use the [PutConfigRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_PutConfigRule.html) action\.

The `Owner` field should be `CUSTOM_POLICY`\. The following additional fields are required for AWS Config Custom Policy rules:
+ `Runtime`: The runtime system for your AWS Config Custom Policy rules\.
+ `PolicyText`: The policy that defines the logic for your AWS Config Custom Policy rules\.
+ `EnableDebugLogDelivery`: The Boolean expression for enabling debug logging for your AWS Config Custom Policy rule\. The default value is `false`\.
