# Operational Best Practices for CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1\.3 Level 1<a name="operational-best-practices-for-cis_aws_benchmark_level_1"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

The following provides a sample mapping between the Center for Internet Security \(CIS\) Amazon Web Services Foundation v1\.3 Level 1 and AWS managed Config rules/AWS Config Process Checks\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more CIS Amazon Web Services Foundation v1\.3 Level 1 controls\. A CIS Amazon Web Services Foundation v1\.3 Level 1 control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

For more infomation about process checks, see [AWS Config Process Checks Within a Conformance Pack](process-checks.md)\.

**AWS Region:** All supported AWS Regions except Middle East \(Bahrain\)
